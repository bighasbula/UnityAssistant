# UnityAssistant
#Some work I made for a diploma project. All Apis in the code are tester api and no longer work so you will need to change them to your apis. The project itself is an AI assistant in Unity. I used openrouter for "ChatGPT" script generating and wanted to use Replicate AI for 3d object generation. Although 3d generation was scrapped because I didnt pay, the logic supposedely works. There is also an import logic of 3d objects into the scene by the GLTfast module. Everything mostly works, but scrappily. The game itself was just made for presentation of the assistant.
